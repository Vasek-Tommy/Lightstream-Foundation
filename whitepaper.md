# Lightstream Coin v1.1 – Prior Art & Whitepaper  
**Inventor:** Lightstream Foundation  
**Date:** November 11, 2025  
**License:** AGPL-3.0 + Commercial Enterprise starting at 250,000 CHF/year

## 1. The Problem  
Blockchain is **bloated, slow, energy-intensive, and not quantum-secure**.  
Bitcoin: 7 TPS, 600 GB, 150 TWh/year, ECDSA (quantum-vulnerable).  

---

## 2. The Solution: **No Chain. Just Stream.**  
A **continuous stream** of transactions replaces the blockchain.  
Stored in **SmartLightKey™ (Key 4)** – a physical USB key with 4 cryptographic layers:

| **Key** | **Function** |
|--------|-------------|
| Key 1 | Identity (KYC-free, anonymous) |
| Key 2 | Stream (transaction log) |
| Key 3 | Consensus (offline P2P sync) |
| Key 4 | Smart Contract (Python on-device) |

---

## 3. Technical Innovations  
- **Offline P2P:** QR/NFC scan → <10 ms, 0 fees  
- **1 Million TPS:** Stream scales linearly, no block bloat  
- **Quantum-Secure:** NIST PQC (Kyber, Dilithium, SPHINCS+)  
- **Storage:** < 1 MB per key  
- **Energy:** 0 W (no mining)  

---

## 4. Token & Economy  
- **LST:** 1,000,000,000 total supply  
- **Genesis:** Embedded in every Key 4  
- **Use Case:** Optional for value transfer  
- **Enterprise:** 250,000 CHF/year (SDK + support)  

---

## 5. Governance  
- **Year 1–2:** Centralized (Lightstream Foundation)  
- **Year 3+:** DAO (LST holders)
